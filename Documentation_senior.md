## Project Overview

This project implements a merge sort algorithm and a binary search algorithm in C++. The primary functionality involves sorting an array of integers using merge sort and then searching for a specific element within the sorted array using binary search.

## Functionality

* **Merge Sort:** The `mergeSort` function recursively divides the input array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and then merges the sorted subarrays back together. This divide-and-conquer approach results in an efficient sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n).

* **Binary Search:**  After the array is sorted, the `main` function prompts the user to enter an element to search for. It then performs a binary search on the sorted array to determine if the element is present. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), making it efficient for searching large sorted datasets.

## Dependencies

This project uses standard C++ libraries, including `<bits/stdc++.h>` for input/output operations, array manipulation, and algorithm implementations. No external dependencies are required.

## Architecture

The code is structured into two main functions: `mergeSort` for sorting and the `main` function for user interaction and searching. The `merge` function is a helper function used by `mergeSort` to combine sorted subarrays.

The program first initializes an integer array and sorts it using the `mergeSort` function. Then, it interacts with the user, prompting them to input a search element. The binary search is performed using a `while` loop, which checks the middle element of the search range and adjusts the search range accordingly until the element is found or the search range is exhausted. If the element is found, its index is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed.
