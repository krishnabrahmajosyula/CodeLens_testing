# Understanding the CodeLens_testing Project

This project demonstrates sorting and searching a list of numbers using C++. Imagine you have a mixed-up deck of cards, and you want to arrange them in order, then find a specific card. This project shows you how to do that with numbers.

## What the code does

1. **Sorts a list of numbers:** It uses "Merge Sort" to arrange the numbers from smallest to largest. Think of it like organizing playing cards by suit and number.

2. **Searches for a number:** After sorting, the code lets you search for a specific number. It uses "Binary Search," which is much faster than checking each number individually. Think of it like searching for a word in a dictionary – you don't start from the beginning and check every word.

## How it works – A simple explanation

* **Merge Sort:** Imagine dividing your mixed-up numbers into smaller piles, sorting each pile, and then merging the sorted piles back together. This is repeated until all numbers are sorted.

* **Binary Search:** Imagine looking for a number in a sorted list. You check the middle number. If it's your number, great! If not, you decide if your number is bigger or smaller, then search only in that half of the list. You repeat this until you find your number, or you know it's not there.

## What you need

The code uses a C++ library (`<bits/stdc++.h>`) that provides pre-written tools. Think of a library like a toolbox. However, it's important to know this particular library isn't standard and might not work everywhere.  It's generally better practice to include individual, standard libraries like `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.

## Critical parts of the code

* **`merge()`:** This part merges two sorted smaller lists into one sorted list during the Merge Sort process.
* **`mergeSort()`:** This part performs the sorting by dividing the list and using `merge()` to combine the sorted parts.
* **`main()`:** This is where the program starts. It creates the initial list of numbers, calls `mergeSort()` to sort them, then lets you enter a number to search for using Binary Search. Finally, it prints the sorted list and whether the number was found.
