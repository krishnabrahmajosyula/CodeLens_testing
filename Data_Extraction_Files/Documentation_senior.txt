# CodeLens_testing Documentation

## Overview

This project implements a merge sort algorithm and a binary search algorithm. It processes a predefined array of integers, sorts it using merge sort, and then allows the user to search for a specific element within the sorted array using binary search. The index of the element, if found, or -1 if not present, is displayed to the user.

## Functionality

* **Sorting:** The project utilizes the merge sort algorithm to efficiently sort the provided integer array in ascending order. This involves recursively dividing the array into smaller sub-arrays until each contains a single element, and then merging these sub-arrays back together in sorted order.

* **Searching:** After sorting, a binary search algorithm is employed to find the user-specified element within the sorted array.  Binary search efficiently determines the presence and location of the target value by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

## Architecture

The core components of the code are:

* **`merge(int a[], int begin, int mid, int end)`:** This function is responsible for merging two sorted sub-arrays into a single sorted array. It receives the original array and the indices delimiting the two sub-arrays.

* **`mergeSort(int a[], int begin, int end)`:**  This recursive function implements the merge sort algorithm. It divides the input array into sub-arrays and then utilizes the `merge` function to combine them in sorted order.

* **`main()`:** This function initializes an integer array, calls `mergeSort` to sort it, prompts the user for an element to search, performs the binary search, and prints the sorted array and the search result (index or -1).

## Dependencies

The project relies on the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file. This is a non-standard header file specific to GCC and includes numerous standard C++ headers.  For enhanced portability, it's recommended to replace this with individual standard headers like `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, etc. as needed. This would ensure compatibility across different compilers and platforms.
